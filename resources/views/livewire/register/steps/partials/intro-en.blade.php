<h2>Who we are</h2>

<p>
    MetaFilter is a publicly-viewable community with three pillars: sharing and talking about &ldquo;stuff found on the Internet&rdquo;
    on various subjects, asking and answering questions, and discussing popular media.
    We strive to be a friendly and inclusive harassment-free zone.
</p>

<p>We hope you&rsquo;ll join us!</p>

<h2>$5 one-time sign-up fee</h2>

<p>
    There is a one-time US$5 charge to create an account on MetaFilter, to discourage spammers.
    Once you complete the sign-up form you&rsquo;ll be directed to PayPal to finish the process.
